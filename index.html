          <h2>The TL;DR</h2>
          <p>This is the portfolio of Kelsey Langlois, a web programming student in Seattle, Washington. I’ve done some programming in Java and Python, and just finished learning JavaScript and Ruby on Rails at Epicodus. On this page you’ll find links to my projects, as well as a bit about my background and interests.</p>

          <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
          <p>One of the best descriptions I’ve heard of the emotions around programming is that one is usually in one of the following two states:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Frustration as one grapple some problem in one’s code.</li>
            <li>Triumph when one solves the problem.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>And that's a large part of why I want to pursue a career in programming: because it’s challenging, interesting, and rewarding; because it stretches both my logical and creative muscles; and because I’d rather feel frustration and triumph by turns than feel neither at all.</p>

          <h2><a name="other-stuff">Other Interests</a></h2>
          <p>When I’m not coding or learning to code, I’m likely up to one of the following:</p>
          <ul class="other-stuff">
            <li>
              Reading: I tend towards Sci-fi and Fantasy, with some literary novels thrown in. I just read <em>The Argonauts</em>, by Maggie Nelson, and planning on rereading <em>Annihilation</em>, by Jeff Vandermeer soon.
            </li>
            <li>
              Watching shows or movies: Once again, often Sci-fi and Fantasy, two of the reigning (currently airing) favorites are <em>Steven Universe</em> and <em>Bojack Horseman</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gaming: Many of my favorites are indie games (Most recently <em>The Banner Saga 2</em>) but I'm also a fan of <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, and <em>Portal</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing: Both fiction and essays. I'll likely be practicing my skills from Epicodus on finally making a blog for my ramblings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Listening to music: Both live and recorded, and varying from electro-swing to rock to twee pop.
            </li>
          </ul>
